- **Video?**   
Here is a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-ZkihZujCY) video. Here is a [Demo](http://counfties.com). 

- **What?**  
This is a Decentralized Application (Dapp). You can own countries and display your message on them. The leaderboard shows the wealthiest countries.  

- **What's in it for me?**  
Once you own a country you're now it's king. You message will be displayed on that countries page. Each time a country is bought, it's price increases by 20%. If someone buys your country, you get your BNB back + an extra 10%.  

- **So now what?**  
Continue to the site. Explore it on the BSC main net or the BSC test net.  

- **Goal?**  
Have an blockchain powered world war between wealthiest countries.  

**Disclaimer:** for the best experience, use a desktop!

- **How to run?**
Publish the contract code to the Binance Smart Chain main net/test net. Once you've done this you need to copy the contract address to the 'connectToWallet.js' file (Line 111/115). I recommend [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/).

	Now you need to run the project on a network. I recmommend using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) plugin.
